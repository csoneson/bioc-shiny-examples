## Bioconductor shiny app examples

This repository contains basic example scripts for launching some shiny 
applications provided in Bioconductor packages, using example data. 
Each example is provided via a small R script. 
Most of the code in these scripts comes directly from the vignettes or examples 
in the respective packages.
